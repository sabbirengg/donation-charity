                <p>Your gift is a sacred trust. We promise to honor your generosity and use your donation in the most
                    effective way
                    possible. The gift options shown reflect World Vision projects and the suggested donation amounts
                    are based on periodic
                    surveys of the countries we serve. Each item is representative of the gift category in which it
                    appears, and donations
                    will be used to provide assistance within that gift category where it is needed most. When you give
                    any animal gift, a
                    portion of the gift may also help provide watering sources, farming assistance, hunger relief, and
                    other related
                    essentials as needed.

                    solution at just the right
                    time. And while your gifts are at work changing lives, youâ€™ll get to see the power of your
                    generosity through quarterly
                    updates and the World Vision magazine. This family will be very happy with your small size donation.

                <h1>Education for a child</h1>
                <p>Every year, our charity supports around 100 development projects (such as schools or accommodation
                    for pupils) and
                    manages 10 centres and 78 boarding houses.

                    One of our core values is to minimize admin costs, so we can increase the impact of your donations.
                    This is shown in our
                    excellent charitable expenditure rate, which is at 85.3%.

                    When you sponsor a child in Asia, a bond grows between you and your sponsored child thanks to the
                    exchange of letters.
                    You are simply making a life-changing gift to someone in Southeast Asia.
